# hello-world
Yet another repository by some github n00b

In this cycle, I'm a larval python programmer working on Raspberry Pi projects (mostly) to become fluent. I hope to apply some of the python skills I learn to my day job, where I'm not a programmer, but I have to talk to them.

Stuff to do to become a legit blogger:
[x] get a development box sorted
[x] make sure all the Jekyll plumbing runs
[ ] sort out SSH keys to auth to github
[x] get a better editor
[ ] practice Jekyll kung-fu on a throwaway project
[ ] get an image munger
[ ] find out how templates actually work in Jekyll
[ ] choose a template
[ ] proceduralize and document the posting to gh-pages, (maybe from atom ?)
